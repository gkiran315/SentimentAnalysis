# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis of reviews in marketing area help in making the best decisions regarding the product. Here, in this project, I am estimating the
sentiment of movie reviews either positive or negative score taking IMDB dataset into consideration. I have used Nave Bayes classifier and Decision Tree for text
classification on different sample sizes and compared the Accuracies taking single words and Bigrams into considerations. I have also evaluated Evaluation methods like
positive precision and positive recall, negative precision and negative recall for Nave Bayes and Decision Tree on different sample sizes.
